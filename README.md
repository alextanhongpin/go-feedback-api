# go-feedback-api

:love_letter: You have a feedback form on your website and wants the feedback sent to be delivered to your email, in a convenient way.


What if I told you that...

    There is an API for that.

With this line, this api is under your command...

```bash
$ go run main.go -username YOUR_GMAIL_EMAIL -password YOUR_GMAIL_PASSWORD -to EMAIL_YOU_WANT_TO_SEND_TO
```
